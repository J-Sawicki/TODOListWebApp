# TODOListWebApp
This is App that I've written. I was writing back-end components, front-end was not done by me.
It's simple web app, it lets you add new thing to list and also check and uncheck them as done/not done. 
Technologies used are Java and Spring Framework, with usage of Netty, Hibernate, Flyway and Maven.
